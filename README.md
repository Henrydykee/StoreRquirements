mobile app screenshot requirements for app store and playstore
APPLE SCREENSHOT SPECIFICATIONS

First of all, the screenshot images need to be in either PNG or JPG, with no alpha or transparency in the image. 
 
Apple requires for you to upload screenshots for 4 different screen sizes/device, which is iPhone 6.5" Display, iPhone 5.5" Display, iPad Pro (3rd Gen) 12.9" Display, and iPad Pro (2nd Gen) 12.9" Display, so you will need to prepare screenshots with different dimensions to cater to these screen sizes:
iPhone 6.5" Display requires screenshots with dimension 1242 x 2688 (4 IMAGES)
iPhone 5.5" Display requires screenshots with dimension 1242 x 2208(4 IMAGES)
iPad Pro (3rd Gen) 12.9" Display requires screenshots with dimension 2048 x 2732 (4 IMAGES)
iPad Pro (2nd Gen) 12.9" Display requires screenshots with dimension 2048 x 2732 (4 IMAGES)
At least one screenshot need to reflect your app in use. Only using marketing or promotional materials that do not at all reflect the UI of the app will most likely be rejected by Apple. Make sure that at least one of your screenshots accurately show what the user will see if they download your app.
 
If you plan on using a device frame within the screenshot, please note that you will need to showcase the correct device. 
 
For example, for iPhone 6.5" Display, you will need to showcase the iPhone XS Max or iPhone XR within the frame. If you use iPhone X in the frame (which has 5.8" Display), you are not displaying the app in the correct device frame and Apple will most likely reject the app. 
iPhone 6.5" Display devices are: iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR
iPhone 5.5" Display devices are: iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus
The same goes for the iPad screenshots. If you want to showcase the iPad device within the screenshot, you will need to showcase the iPad Pro 3rd Gen and iPad Pro 2nd Gen.
