# 📱 App Store & Play Store Screenshot Requirements

This guide outlines the required specifications for uploading mobile app screenshots to the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store**, including formats, sizes, devices, and best practices. It is designed to help you avoid common rejection issues and ensure your screenshots meet platform standards.

## 🍎 Apple App Store Screenshot Requirements

### ✅ Format

* PNG or JPG format only
* No alpha channels (no transparency allowed)

### 📐 Required Device Sizes & Dimensions

You must upload screenshots for **four Apple device types**:

| Device                   | Dimensions (W x H) | Screenshot Count | Example Device                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| iPhone 6.5" Display      | 1242 x 2688 px     | Minimum 4        | iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR       |
| iPhone 5.5" Display      | 1242 x 2208 px     | Minimum 4        | iPhone 6s Plus, 7 Plus, 8 Plus |
| iPad Pro 12.9" (3rd Gen) | 2048 x 2732 px     | Minimum 4        | iPad Pro (2018)                |
| iPad Pro 12.9" (2nd Gen) | 2048 x 2732 px     | Minimum 4        | iPad Pro (2017)                |

### 🔍 UI Requirement

* At least **one screenshot must show the app in actual use**.
* Avoid using purely promotional graphics — your screenshots must **reflect the real UI**.

### 📱 Device Frames

If you use device mockups (frames) in your screenshots:

* Make sure you match the correct device for the size.
* Example: A screenshot meant for iPhone 6.5" **must** show the app inside an iPhone XS Max or XR frame.

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

* Do not show an iPhone X for a 6.5" requirement.
* Do not submit screenshots without any real app UI.
